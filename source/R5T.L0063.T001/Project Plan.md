# R5T.L0063.T001
Structured signature string types.


## Notes

1. There is no ErrorSignatureString. That is for identity strings, and only because identity strings appear in output XML documentation file, and there identity strings can be errors.
2. There is no NamespaceSignatureString. That is for identity strings, and only because the identity string specification allows it.
